          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p class="text-muted">Access to electricity is important for promoting economic development along with improving living conditions.
            Around <a href="https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Access_to_electricity">1.2 billion people worldwide do not have electricity in their homes</a>, 
            many of them located in Africa and Asia. The first step in this process is to understand the location of existing energy infrastructure, which helps enable analysis of 
            the distribution of energy resources as well as the consumption of energy. Doing this through surveys
            is incredibly time-consuming, which is why we are trying to locate energy infrastructure automatically by applying deep learning techniques to overhead imagery.

          </p>
          <!--Access to electricity is one of the most important requisites to economic and
            societal development. It is associated with decreased maternal mortality, increased education levels,
            and decreased poverty.
            However, 1 billion people still lack access to electricity. To enable electrification and grid expansion
            in energy-poor regions, it is crucial to know where the existing infrastructure is. This information can
            help policymakers and businesses decide on whether to expand the national grid, build a microgrid, or
            provide direct off-grid solar PV. Current approaches to identifying and mapping energy infrastructure
            tend to be expensive and time-intensive, consisting of aggregating survey data from the ground level and
            roughly scaling it across regions. This is where we want to help.
            Our goal as a team is to be able to build a tool
            that researchers can use to identify and map out worldwide energy
            infrastructure to supplement ground truth information and allow energy developers and
            policymakers to make informed decisions on grid expansion-->

          <h3 style="text-align: left;">Deep Learning and Object Detection</h3>
          <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">Using deep learning, we can feed an image to a model, and the model is able to make predictions about the contents or characteristics of that image. A common
            technique for image analysis is classification, in which the model predicts the class of the image out of a list of possible classes.
            In the image below, the model predicts that the image is of a cat, and is 90% confident with this classification. The model learns how to predict these classifications based
            on examples that are shown to it. After it has been trained, it can classify images that it has not seen before.<br>
            <br>
            For this project, we are focusing on object detection, which is a combination of classification with localization. The model analyzes images and predicts bounding boxes that
            surround each object. It then also classifies each object, producing a confidence score corresponding to the prediction. In the image below, the model predicted that there was
            an object in the box shown in red, and also predicted that the object within that box is a cat. The model learns how to predict these boxes and classifications based on examples shown to it.
            These examples have labels that we refer to as ground truth that contain the information of where the objects are in the image.

          <h3 class="service-heading">Background</h3>
          <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;"> 
            For five years, the Duke Energy Data Analytics Lab has worked on developing deep learning models that identify energy infrastructure, with an end goal of
            generating maps of power grid networks that can aid policymakers in implementing effective
            electrification strategies. In 2015-16, researchers created a model that can detect solar photovoltaic arrays with high accuracy <a
                href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/energy-data-analytics-lab-2015-2016">[2015-16
                Bass Connections Team]</a>.
            In 2018-19, this model was improved to identify different types of transmission and distribution energy infrastructures,
            including power lines and transmission towers <a
                href="https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/energy-data-analytics-lab-energy-infrastructure-map-world-through-satellite-data-2018">[2018-19
                Bass Connections Team]</a>. Last year's project focused on increasing the adaptability of detection models
            across different geographies by creating realistic synthetic imagery <a
                href="https://bass-connections-2019.github.io/">[2019-20

          <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;"> Object detection networks, like the one used in this work, are notorious for their "data hunger," requiring 
            <strong>large amounts of annotated training data to perform well</strong>. 
            For common infrastructure like buildings and roads, there is ample real-world data available to train such models.
          However, for rare objects like wind turbines, there is not enough available imagery to satisfy the data requirements of these
				  models. Further, due to their rarity and low spatial density in overhead imagery, acquiring more data can be very expensive.</p>

          <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">
            Since training data is difficult to collect, in this project we explore creating synthetic data to supplement the real data that are available.
            We do this using CityEngine, which can render and generate 3D landscapes and structures
            based on input from the designer. In our case, we are populating a landscape with wind turbine models.
            Then we can position the camera in the overhead position and capture images with similar appearances to overhead imagery. 
            Since we placed the wind turbines in the synthetic image, we can also generate ground truth labels for each of these images.

          <h3 class="service-heading">Research Steps</h3>
          <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Object detection</strong> is a deep
            learning technique which aims to classify and locate target objects in images. For each object the
            model detects, it will assign a probability to its predicted classification and propose a bounding box around the object in the image. 
            To train this type of model, the model's predictions are compared to ground-truth labels, and the model is updated according to this error. 
            In our project, we train a <strong>YOLOv3  image detection network</strong> to locate wind turbines in overhead satellite imagery.

                  From these images, we can notice significant variability in features like land types and even wind turbine 
                  shapes between different states. For example, imagery from California is almost exclusively in 
                  desert regions. California has a range of sizes of wind turbines including some that are small 
                  and densely-clustered. On the other end of the spectrum, states like Maine have mostly large 
                  wind turbines in regions with lots of vegetation. Images from the same state tend to be 
                  relatively self-similar.
            <br><br>
            By including variation in features like geography, wind turbine size, and shadow size in the training dataset,
            the model can generalize more broadly. However, it can be very difficult for the model to learn these novel
            features if they are absent from the training data.

              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left;">To create the synthetic imagery, we first compiled
              a list of overhead images that did not contain wind turbines. These images were for the background on which to generate wind turbine models. We also collected 3D wind turbine
              models from online that we would like to use for the synthetic data. </p>

              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left;">We then used a python script and CityEngine files to randomly select the images and generate the 3D wind turbine models in random locations on top of the images. 
              The script then moves the camera to the four quadrants of the images, and in each location, it captures and saves a photo. This process is then repeated
              with the wind turbine models colored in as black and the background colored as white. These black and white images tell us where the models are placed 
              and can be used to create ground truth labels.</p>

                drawing boxes around each of these models. This is done for each image, giving us a label corresponding with each image, where the label contains the information

              <h2 style="text-align: left;">Basic Experimental Setup</h2>
              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">
                Once we have our synthetic data created and our real imagery preprocessed, we are ready to run experiments. 
                These experiments involve altering the composition of the training dataset to see how the performance of the model changes.
                The basic experimental setup for this project is to train the model on a control condition with just real data, 
                and then to use the same dataset but supplement it with synthetic images, and then measure the difference in performance. This will
                produce two different models and their performance is measured on the same testing set. With this setup, we are only changing
                one variable and so we can attribute any differences in performance to the added synthetic data.

              <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">To understand our results, it's important
              that we first understand the metrics that we have chosen to measure performance. The primary metrics we look at are
              precision and recall. We'll explain how these metrics can be interpreted in terms of the images on the left.</p>
              <ul>
                <li class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Precision: </b> Out of the objects that the model classified as a wind turbine,
                what fraction of these were actually wind turbines.</li>
                <li class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;"><b>Recall: </b> Of the wind turbines present in the data, what fraction of these 
                did the model find.</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">Since the goal of this model is to detect objects in very large sets of overhead imagery, 
                manually removing objects misclassified as wind turbines is much easier than identifying undetected wind turbines across the entire dataset. 
                For this reason, we prioritize recall over precision as a metric of good performance.
              </p>

              <h3>Results</h3>
              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">Adding synthetic data to our training set significantly improved the precision of our
                model. However, the recall does not change significantly. Our hypothesis for this is that with the added synthetic data, model was doing well on large wind turbines
                while missing many of the small wind turbines. This prompted us to create synthetic data that contained small wind turbines to try to 
                fix this issue.

              <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: justify;">In addition to this first experiment, we also conducted additional experiments by changing
              how the dataset was split between the training and testing. One experiment that we explored was excluding a geographic region from the testing set.
              We wanted to choose a region that would be the most difficult for the model to perform on without having training data to learn from. We chose to 
              exclude California and Arizona from the testing set because the geography is both self-similar and fairly different
              from the other regions and also because the small wind turbines in California would be very difficult for the model to test on.

              and observed how the performance changed.</p>
